While a majority of heroes travel the world during their adventures, <strong>Wayfarers </strong>live for the journey. They are always eager to visit new places and learn from others. In the eyes of a Wayfarer, the wilderness is neither foe nor an ally, but rather a stern teacher who can reveal many forgotten truths.</p><hr /><h5><strong>WAYFARER FREE BENEFITS</strong></h5><ul><li>Permanently increase your maximum Inventory Points by 2.</li></ul><h2><strong>WAYFARER SKILLS</strong></h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.L34pOGhdH0ZwV4Bt]{Faithful Companion} <strong>(SL5)</strong></p><p>Together with the rest of your group, design a level 5 <strong>beast</strong>, <strong>construct</strong>, <strong>elemental </strong>or <strong>plant </strong>creature (<strong>Core Rulebook</strong>, page <strong>304</strong>) that becomes your <strong>companion</strong>.

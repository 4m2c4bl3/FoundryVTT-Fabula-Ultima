    "description": "<div class=\"stackedit__html\"><h1>WEAPON MASTER</h1><h5><strong>ALSO: Fighter, Rōnin, Warrior</strong></h5><p>Weaponmasters spend years upon years honing their close combat arts. Most of them display remarkable skill with a variety of weapons; others have trained to become one with a specific armament. Many <strong>Weaponmasters </strong>follow and protect someone out of love or loyalty, but there are also those who tirelessly wander the world seeking worthy opponents, legendary magical weapons, or capable teachers.</p><p><strong>WEAPONMASTER FREE BENEFITS</strong></p><ul><li>Permanently increase your maximum Hit Points by 5.</li><li>Gain the ability to equip <strong>martial melee weapons</strong> and <strong>martial shields</strong>.</li></ul><h3 id=\"weaponmaster-skills\"><strong>WEAPONMASTER SKILLS</strong></h3><h4><strong>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.IhBCZsilt0bj5RJK]{Bladestorm}</strong></h4><p>When you perform a <strong>melee </strong>attack, you may spend 10 Mind Points to choose one option: the attack gains <strong>multi (2)</strong>; or you increase the attack’s multi property by one, up to a maximum of <strong>multi (3)</strong>.</p><hr /><h4><strong>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.7jWycVYFgZ1BMxch]{Bone Crusher} (SL4)</strong></h4><p>When you hit one or more targets with a <strong>melee </strong>attack that would deal damage, you may have the attack deal no damage. If you do, choose one option: inflict <strong>dazed </strong>on each target hit by the attack; <strong>or </strong>inflict <strong>weak </strong>on each target hit by the attack; <strong>or </strong>each target hit by the attack loses <strong>【SL × 10】 </strong>Mind Points. Describe your maneuver!</p><hr /><h4><strong>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.WZDdQfw9VF64La2P]{Breach} (SL3)</strong></h4><p>You may use an action and spend 5 Mind Points to perform a<strong> free attack</strong> with a <strong>melee</strong> weapon you have equipped. This attack must target a <strong>single creature</strong>. If the attack is successful, it deals no damage and you choose one option: you destroy one shield equipped by the target; <strong>or </strong>you destroy the target’s equipped armor; or whenever the target suffers damage from a source before the start of your next turn, that source deals <strong>【SL × 2】 </strong>extra damage to them.</p><hr /><h4><strong>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.XhcTVGtGEk7L2Ddq]{Counterattack}</strong></h4><p>After an enemy <strong>hits or misses you with a melee attack</strong>, if the Result of their Accuracy Check was an <strong>even number</strong>, you may perform a<strong> free attack </strong>against that enemy (after their attack has been fully resolved). This attack must be a <strong>melee </strong>attack and must have that enemy as its <strong>only </strong>target; treat your<strong> High Roll (HR)</strong> as 0 when calculating damage dealt by this attack.</p><hr /><h4><strong>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.ztxLYzo1ADCaRupR]{Melee Weapon Mastery} (SL4)</strong></h4><p>You gain a bonus equal to <strong>【SL】 </strong>to all Accuracy Checks with <strong>melee </strong>weapons.</p></div>",

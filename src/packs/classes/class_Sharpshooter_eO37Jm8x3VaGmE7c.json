    "description": "<div class=\"stackedit__html\"><h1>SHARPSHOOTER</h1><h5><strong>ALSO: </strong>Archer, Gunslinger, Sniper</h5><p>A majority of <strong>Sharpshooters </strong>are exceptionally good at dealing with threats from a carefully calculated distance; others are brave, skilled or reckless enough to engage their foes at point-blank. While many of these skilled snipers are battle-hardened soldiers, some have turned to a life of piracy, bounty hunting or banditry. A few have put their abilities at the service of the people, or use them to protect a sacred or forbidden site from intruders.</p><p><strong>SHARPSHOOTER FREE BENEFITS</strong></p><ul><li>Permanently increase your maximum Hit Points by 5.</li><li>Gain the ability to equip martial ranged weapons and martial shields.</li></ul><h3 id=\"sharpshooter-skills\"><strong>SHARPSHOOTER SKILLS</strong></h3><h4><strong>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.lCFQMCY4AmDsv6sv]{Barrage} (SL5)</strong></h4><p>When you perform a <strong>ranged </strong>attack, you may spend 10 Mind Points to choose one option: the attack gains <strong>multi </strong>(2); or you increase the attack’s <strong>multi </strong>property by one, up to a maximum of <strong>multi </strong>(3).</p><hr /><h4><strong>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.sIkQa2NzkqsvczBr]{Crossfire} (SL3)</strong></h4><p>After a creature you can see performs a <strong>ranged </strong>attack, you may spend an amount of Mind Points equal to the total Result of their Accuracy Check in order to have the attack fail automatically against all targets. You can only use this Skill if you have a ranged weapon equipped, and it has no effect if the Accuracy Check was a critical success.</p><hr /><h4><strong>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.hmDCgX5OEk5l4uXW]{Hawkeye} (SL5)</strong></h4><p>When you perform the <strong>Guard </strong>action, if you choose <strong>not </strong>to provide cover to another creature, you may choose one option: the next <strong>ranged </strong>attack you perform before the end of the current scene will deal <strong>【SL × 2】 </strong>extra damage; or you may immediately perform a<strong> free attack</strong> with a <strong>bow </strong>or <strong>firearm </strong>you have equipped, treating your <strong>High Roll (HR)</strong> as 0 when calculating damage dealt by this attack.</p><hr /><h4><strong>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.0UxTgrag7cE4M1oc]{Ranged Weapon Mastery} (SL4)</strong></h4><p>You gain a bonus equal to <strong>【SL】 </strong>to all Accuracy Checks with <strong>ranged </strong>weapons.</p><hr /><h4><strong>@UUID[Compendium.projectfu.skills.Item.Ovmw7cMrN6qvagG4]{Warning Shot} (SL4)</strong></h4><p>When you hit one or more targets with a <strong>ranged </strong>attack that would deal damage, you may have the attack deal no damage. If you do, choose one option: inflict <strong>shaken </strong>on each target hit by the attack; <strong>or </strong>inflict <strong>slow </strong>on each target hit by the attack; <strong>or </strong>each target hit by the attack loses <strong>【SL × 10】 </strong>Mind Points. Describe your maneuver!</p></div>",

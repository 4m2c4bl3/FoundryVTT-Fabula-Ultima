In addition to the obvious advantages in mobility, your <strong>melee</strong> attacks can target <strong>flying</strong> creatures and you cannot be targeted by <strong>melee</strong> attacks unless the attacker is flying or is somehow able to reach flying targets.</p><p>These benefits do not apply while you are unable to fly freely (such as when inside a vehicle designed for human-sized creatures, or inside a narrow corridor). Additionally, when you suffer <strong>air</strong>, <strong>bolt</strong> or <strong>ice</strong> damage during a conflict scene, you lose these benefits until the start of your next turn.</p>"

# Commit Message Prefixes

In the context of Git commits, these terms are often used as part of commit messages to provide a concise description of the changes made in a commit. Using a consistent structure for commit messages helps improve code collaboration and makes it easier to understand the purpose of each commit. The commonly used prefixes in commit messages are as follows:

-   **feat**: Introducing new features or functionality.
    Example: `feat: Add user authentication feature`

-   **chore**: Maintenance tasks, build processes, or non-user-facing changes.
    Example: `chore: Update dependencies`

-   **fix**: Addressing bugs or issues.
    Example: `fix: Correct calculation in revenue calculation`

-   **docs**: Changes to documentation.
    Example: `docs: Update API documentation`

-   **style**: Code style changes (formatting, indentation, etc.).
    Example: `style: Format code according to style guide`

-   **refactor**: Restructuring or optimizing existing code.
    Example: `refactor: Reorganize folder structure`

-   **test**: Adding or modifying tests.
    Example: `test: Add unit tests for user authentication`

-   **perf**: Performance improvements.
    Example: `perf: Optimize database queries for faster response times`

These prefixes help create a standardized way of categorizing and understanding the nature of the changes made in a commit. They contribute to better communication and collaboration among developers working on a project, making it easier to review and track changes over time.
